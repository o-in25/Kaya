/*************************************************** initial.c ************************************************************
	Contains he bootcode for the Kaya Operating System. It contains the definitions for the gobal variables required for
    phase2, being the process count, the softblocked count, the current process (henceforth, jobs and processes will be 
    synonymous), and the ready queue - the queue of jobs who status is marked as ready. In main, there are a number of 
    boot opertions. First, the four new areas in low memory are populated to support context switching. The stack 
    pointer will be set, the program counter will be reflected appropriately and the status of VM will be off, 
    interrupts will be masked, and kernel mode is on. Process control blocks are allocated and the ASL is set.
