/*************************************************** initial.c ************************************************************
	inital.c is the bootcode for the Kaya Operating System. It contains the definitions for the gobal variables required for
    phase2, being the process cout, the softblocked count, the current process, and the ready queue - the queue of jobs who
    status is marked as ready. In main, there are a number of boot opertions. First, the four new areas in low memory are 
    populated to support context switching. The stack pointer will be set, the program counter will be reflected appropriately
    and the status of VM will be off, interrupts will be masked, and kernel mode is on. Process control blocks are allocated
    and the ASL is set.
