/*************************************************** interrupts.c ************************************************************
	Interrupts.c is the I/O handler. In the I/O handler, the following steps are taken: first, the
    interrupt line that is on is determined (for convience and organization, the devices 3-7 are stored
    as constants in constants.h). Next, with the line number, the device instance must be determined, 
    and the address of that device's regsiter must be acquired.
