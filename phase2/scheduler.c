/*************************************************** scheduler.c ********************************************************
	Manages the requests for new jobs in the Kaya OS and is resonsible for scheduling them. The scheduler will 
    check if there are any jobs in the ready queue. If there are no jobs in the ready queue, the schedule 
    will ten determine why. If there are no processes listed as running, then the system halts. Otherwise, if 
    there is a record of processes running (the process count is greater than zero), then it will check if 
    any of these jobs are simply waiting on IO to finish. If they are, the scheduler will simply invoke the ROM
    reserved WAIT instruction - and sets up the bit masks for the next job. Otherwise, it enters a kernel panic.
    If there are jobs in the ready queue, however, the scheduler grab a job from the ready queue,
    will initialize their timer, set their quantum, and perform a context switch on that new job.

    This module contributes function definitions and a few sample fucntion implementations to the contributors put 
    forth by the Kaya OS project.
